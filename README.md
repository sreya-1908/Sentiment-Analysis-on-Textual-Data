## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather textual data from appropriate sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze data to uncover insights.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Transform text into numerical features.
5. **Model Development**: Build and train machine learning models for sentiment classification.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated based on metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The results of the sentiment analysis will be presented in visualizations and summary metrics, showcasing the model's effectiveness in classifying sentiments.
